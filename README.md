#Mean Variance Optimizer


This project is an attempt at creating an optimal portfolio given multiple different assets. Using a gamma value of 1.0 should be a rough approximation for a kelly criterion maximizing portfolio. 

Running the application requires predicting the returns, correlations, and standard deviation of all included assets. 


Research for the calculation comes from Tony Yiu's article: https://towardsdatascience.com/portfolio-optimization-with-scipy-aa9c02e6b937, the Bogleheads user Uncorrelated (https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=322366), and the SciPy documentation.
